UPDATING
========

In a nutshell, the assembly's version is compared to the one broadcasted
by the remote server. If the latter is higher, then a download link will
be provided.

This only occurs when the loader is present in a directory with a
working SPV3 installation. The loader should ideally not be updated when
it's used to install SPV3 packages, as subsequent updates may break
compatibility.
