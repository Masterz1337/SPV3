CONFIGURATION
=============

This documentation outlines how the SPV3 loader lays out and handles the
configuration of:

-   its own settings, which are mainly persistent parameters for hce;
-   hxe settings, which include the kernel and post-processing settings;
-   opensauce settings, primarily the post-processing ones.

This is also written so I can remember in months time the disaster I've
managed to come up.

OBJECT LAYOUT
-------------

Not my favourite architectural style, but deadlines are deadlines.
Luckily, my 2-space indentation will make the nested classes tolerable.
Purists will hate partials.

This is particularly easier to deal with than passing objects around for
shared access. Well, only time will tell. What could possibly go wrong?

SPV3 LOADER
-----------

This one's a little saner. The SPV3 loader settings are stored in its
own dedicated binary at:

    %APPDATA%\SPV3\loader.bin
