LOADING
=======

Loading is conducted by invoking HXE's kernel bootstrapper with the
parameters defined in the SPV3 loader's configuration.

CONDITIONS
----------

SPV3 relies on HXE's context checker to determine if it should load
SPV3, install SPV3, or bark at the user for not putting the loader in
the proper directory.

The SPV3 loader won't permit loading if the HCE executable is not
present. Should that be the case, it will check if a manifest is present
in the data folder of the working directory. If neither is present, then
the aforementioned complaining will occur.

ENHANCEMENTS
------------

Like HXE, the SPV3 loader conducts its own enhancements. Whereas HXE
only focuses on profile enhancements, the SPV3 loader handles:

-   forcing hxe to use the spv3 compatibility mode;
-   fix hud & menu scaling in opensauce settings;
-   impose chimera enhancements (interpolation, aa, uncap cinematic, lod
    block);

All of the enhancements are conducted *before* bootstrapping SPV3, of
course. :-)
